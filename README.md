# grenadeSelection
____

##  This program is intended for avid mobile phone enthusiasts games who play mobile games in their free time toys on *emulator*.

## In shooters on *mobile devices*, and in shooters in general, there is a grenade throwing function. Everything is adapted for phones and the interface is intuitive, but when a *mobile game runs on a computer*, not everything is so convenient - one key is needed for each grenade and reaching for 4 keys is not always convenient.

## This program is designed to eliminate this problem and, by pressing just one button, select any grenade.
